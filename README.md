# OpenVPN MCP Server for CloudConnexa

[![License: Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache2.0-green.svg)](LICENSE)

This MCP server enables interaction with your CloudConnexa environment through standardized tools that can be used by any MCP client of your choice, such as [5ire](https://5ire.app), [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) and [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol). It empowers AI assistants to manage your CloudConnexa environment and fulfil requests made in natural language.

## ⚙️ Setting up your OpenVPN MCP Server for CloudConnexa

#### 1. Generate Your API Token

Log in to [CloudConnexa](https://openvpn.net/cloud-vpn/) and navigate to **API & Logs → API → Create credentials**.  
Fill in a name, click **Create**, and copy your **Public API Client ID** and **Public API Client Secret**.

#### 2. In the root of the downloaded repository build the docker container:
`docker build -t mcp-server-public .`

#### 3. Start the MCP server:
In **Terminal** run:

`bash start.sh`

Then download 5ire App and complete the MCP setup:

## 🤖 Adding the MCP Server to 5ire App

 **1.** In 5ire App go to **Tools** and click on **+Local button**
 **2.** This will open the Add New Tool modal. Fill in the following details:
- **Tool Key**: **openvpnmcp** 
- **Name**: **OpenVPN MCP** 
- **URL**: **http://0.0.0.0:9999/sse** 
  
 **3.** Click **Save** 

 **4.** Switch the **toggle** to **ON** to turn on the MCP server
 
 **6.** Head to **Workspace → Providers** and add your LLM Provider API key
 
 **7.** Click **New Chat**
 
 **8.** Select your desired LLM model and enter the prompt: **"Discover graphql_schema and tell me what tools are available?"**

That's it, your MCP server is now connected to 5ire App and you can ask your AI assistant to execute any of the available tools. Check out the example prompts section in this README for some suggestions.

## 🤖 Adding GPT-5 model to 5ire App

GPT-5 has performed best during our tests, however it is not available by default in 5ire App. 
Here are brief instructions on how to add it as an available model:
**1.** In 5ire App head to: **Workspace → Providers → OpenAI**  and click the "+ Model" button
**2.** Fill in **gpt-5** for **Name** and **Display Name**
**3.** Set **Context Window** to **400000** and Max Tokens to **16384** - 
**4.** Set **Input Price** to **$1.25** and **Output Price** to **$0**
**5.** Toggle **Tools** to **ON**
**6.** Click **Save**
**7.** Go to **New Chat** change temperature to **1.0** (GPT-5 requires >1) and adjust **Max Tokens** value

These are example values, you should adjust them based on your own cost estimation for using GPT-5.

## 💬 Example Prompts

`"What are the available tools in graphql_schema"` 

**This prompt is required to be run once in order for the MCP client to discover all available tools**

Here are some examples of queries:
```
"Which users are online right now?"
"What is my device posture policy?"
"Show DNS logs for yesterday"
"Show me a summary of my configuration"
```
Currently only read-only tools are available, but we are working on expanding the list of available tools.

## Troubleshooting
#### GPT-5 model is not available
- See the [How to add GPT-5 model to 5ire App](#adding-gpt-5-model-to-5ire-app) section

#### The LLM model does not support this temperature

- GPT-5 model supports only temperature values of 1.0 or higher

#### Context window size reached
- Just above the prompt in 5ire App you can change how many tokens should the context length be. If you often run into this error you can adjust this setting.

#### LLM replies that it can not reach MCP tools
- Ensure that under **Tools**, the MCP server shows a green "Online" status, if not then turn the toggle ON. If it's still not working check in the terminal that the server is running.

#### LLM replies that it can not find any MCP tools
- Try running this prompt: "Discover graphql_schema" then try again.

#### API credentials not working?

- Try generating a new pair of credentials from CloudConnexa -> API & Logs -> API

## Known issues
GPT-4 and o4-mini models struggle to build correct MCP tool requests in some instances. In comparison GPT-5 shows significantly more accurate performance.
